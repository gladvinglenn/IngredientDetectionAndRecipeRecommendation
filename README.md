Dishcovery is a smart machine learning project that detects ingredients from food images and recommends Indian recipes using a trained image classifier and a logistic regression-based recommender. Built for our Machine Learning class at WPI, it features a sleek Streamlit interface and a modular backend.

Features :
🖼️ Upload an image → detect ingredients (via CNN model)
✍️ Type ingredients manually (optional)
🔄 Combine both for better accuracy
🍛 Get Indian recipes instantly using logistic regression on a custom dataset
💻 Easy-to-use Streamlit interface (no CLI needed)
